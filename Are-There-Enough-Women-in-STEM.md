Abstract
========
Numerous papers have identified weakening of math and science education in the United States. In response, substantial policy initiatives have been dedicated to increasing the number of science, technology, and engineering (STEM) graduates. Particular attention has been focused on the recruitment of young women. However, the precise definition of STEM is unclear. The authors conducted a survey of the definition of STEM from several Midwestern states, national non-profits, and U.S. governmental organizations. The definitions are applied to enrollment statistics for Iowa’s 15 community colleges, where the authors find the percentage of women enrolled in STEM is highly sensitive to the definition. Consequently, the policy discussion revolving around STEM graduates and the STEM pipeline is severely hampered by the variations to the definitions of STEM.
 
Introduction
============
Educators and policy makers have put substantial efforts toward increasing the number of quality of graduates from science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The demand for STEM programming comes from several needs. In particular, student performance in the area of math and science has deteriorated. This has permeated to the job market where the proportion of scientists and engineers born in the United States has declined. 
Federal and state governments have employed a number of strategies to improve STEM education. States have increased secondary graduation requirements to include more math and science courses, some states have implemented pre-engineering curriculum, and many have sought to increase the participating of women and minorities in STEM programs. But while numerous papers have been dedicated to developing STEM pathways and increasing enrollment parity, the precise definition of STEM has been unclear. Thus, without a clear definition, measuring progress or evaluating STEM programming is problematic.
This paper demonstrates simple accountability questions, such as “are there enough women in STEM?” is sensitive to the definition of STEM itself.
We attempt to resolve this issue by reviewing and institutional surveying of surrounding Midwestern state governments, national institutions and nonprofits. The results of our research show an inconsistent definition of STEM has been employed on the national and regional level. While the lack of a universal definition allows an institution to develop their own definitions of STEM, this reduces the value of STEM data due to the lack of comparability. Simple policy and accountability questions, such as, “are there enough women in STEM?” is sensitive to the definition of STEM itself.
Nevertheless, a common theme—even though weak at times—is STEM seems to refer to any program that involves any aspect of math, science, or engineering. While this may make sense on the surface, it fails to distinguish STEM from the math and science initiatives of the National Defense Education Act (1958). We propose a definition of STEM which emphasizes the interconnectivity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Our definition is heavily rooted in the history and philosophy of science, which is distinguishable from prior math and science initiatives.
After proposing a conceptual definition of STEM and a list of programs, we measure the level of (in)equity between women and minorities in STEM programs at Iowa’s community colleges. We find that minorities are proportionally represented in those programs, but women are severely underrepresented.
Section 2 gives an overview on the need for STEM education and its stated purpose; section 3 illustrates the antecedents for the multiple definition; section 4 proposes a definition of STEM; section 5 describes data collected for our survey; section 6 compares the proportion of women and under-represented minorities in STEM for various definitions; and section 7 concludes with our appeal for inter-agency cooperation in generating more uniform standards in selecting STEM data parameters.

The Need for STEM
=================
STEM advocates have sought to increase the number of students by repairing the "STEM Pipeline". The concept of the pipeline is that problems have a genesis that tends to build and magnify subsequent problems.  In essence, inputs and activities are reflected in outputs, both positive and negative.  For example, if American students are failing to achieve basic and proficient scores on math and science at the primary level, then it would logically follow that they will continue to fall behind at the secondary and post-secondary levels, as well. Ultimately, the problem will cumulinate with an undersupply of qualified STEM workers. However, before we can discuss the solution (STEM), we must fully understand the problem from which it arose and how that influences our conceptual understanding of STEM.
Our challenges in math and science appear to originate at the primary and secondary level.  The National Science Board (2007) found that the United States student achievement-levels in math and science are not competitive e compared to their international peers.  International testing ranked U.S. students 19th out of 29 nations; placing U.S. students behind countries like New Zealand, Hungary and the Slovak Republic.  They further found that nearly a third of U.S. college students required remedial math and sciences courses in their first year of college.  According to Kuenzi (2008) American students scored lower in composite scores than: Singapore, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, South Korea, Japan, Hungary, Hong Kong, Estonia, and Chinese Taipei.  Worse, he found many American students are not even at basic levels, much less proficient in math skills. 
According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) anywhere from 10 to 35 percent of all American students score under the basic skill-level in math.  In 2005, nearly a third of all students tested below basic skill levels in math.  In essence, a significant portion of American students are failing to achieve the standards set by American educators, much less remain competitive with their international peers. 
Lowell, Salzman, Bernstein, & Henderson (2009), found that even America’s highest performing students are not interested in STEM majors. In part, Bettinger (2009) finds students with high ability eventually switch to quantitative business or law, which earn between 5 to 15 percent more than STEM disciplines (Hamermesh & Donald, 2004). Both findings suggest that America’s best and brightest, those whom we count on for innovation and revolutionary ideas, are not demonstrating an interest in STEM and are instead moving into other subfields. 
The issue of gender and racial inequity continue to plague the STEM workforce.  According to the public-private partnership BEST, Building Engineering & Science Talent (2008), in 1999 “despite decades of effort to broaden its base, the U.S. science and engineering workforce remains about 75 percent male and 80 percent white.  Women, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and persons of disabilities – the “underrepresented majority” that makes up two-thirds of the entire U.S. workforce – account for only 25 percent of the technical workforce” (pg. 2).  Chen & Weko (2009) support this assertion, stating “in general, the percentage of students entering STEM fields was higher among male students, younger and dependent students, Asian/Pacific Islander students, foreign students or those who spoke a language other than English as a child, and students with more advantaged family background characteristics and strong academic preparation than among counterparts who did not have these characteristics.” (pg. 17).  They further found that students with these characteristics were more likely to persist in a STEM major and acquire their degree, completing the pipeline.  They also found that drop out and retention rates amongst all students were discouraging; in total, nearly 47 percent of all STEM entrants either switched to a non-STEM area of study or failed to acquire a degree (pg. 18).
This is particularly relevant to our economy as performance in high school math and science correlates to higher wage earnings later in life.  According to Joensen & Nielson (2009) found that students who take higher-level math courses had an average wage 25-30% higher than students that did not.  If there is a definite correlation between wages and skills in math and science, it is certainly in the interest of all to encourage higher performance in these areas. 
As the number of advanced STEM graduates has declined, concern about America’s supply of workers for the STEM workforce have grown.  Over the past 60 years, the United States has shifted from an industrial economy, requiring skills in routine, manual tasks to an information, service-based economy driven by technology that requires non-routine, interactive tasks and skills.  It is estimated that by 2014, 75 percent of the fastest growing occupations will require significant training in math and science (State Educational Technology Directors Association, 2008).  According to Butz, Kelly, Adamson, Bloom, Fossum & Gross (2004) “The implications of a shortage of skills critical to U.S. growth, competitiveness, and security are serious, probably more so now than in recent decades, as are the implications of continuing low entry of female and minority students into many STEM fields” (pg. 10).
In the end and as we first discussed, the backdrop for America’s focus on STEM is the emergence of a new, world economy that is not necessarily dominated by the United States, but rather centered around developing nations competing for global human, organizational and financial capital;  specifically the world’s major population centers, China and India.  In his writing, Friedman (2005) quotes the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Shirley Ann Jackson; she effectively summarizes America’s anxiety about our place in the emerging world economy:  
“The U.S. is still the leading engine for innovation in the world.  It has the best graduate programs, the best scientific infrastructure, and the capital markets to exploit it.  But there is a quiet crisis in U.S. science and technology that we have to wake up to.  The U.S. today is in a truly global environment, and those competitor countries are not only wide awake, they are running a marathon while we are running sprints.  If left unchecked, this could challenge our preeminence and capacity to innovate.” (pg. 253)
The mounting problems related to STEM are evident in the largest economy in the United States, the State of California.According to Offenstein & Shulock (2009) California, the world’s eighth largest economy , owes much of its growth to its higher-than-average number of STEM occupations.  While the state has enjoyed higher numbers of entrepreneurs, venture capital investment, independent patents and broadband deployment; they have conversely suffered from low use of technology within schools, education amongst immigrants, and has one of the lowest rates of bachelor degrees conferred amongst states with “new” economies (pg. 3).  The California Secretary of Labor found that nearly half of all STEM occupations are anticipated to have shortages in the coming years.  However, the growth in STEM degrees granted is not anticipated to meet the growing need for STEM workers.  Furthermore, the current fiscal problems plaguing the State of California are expected to negatively impact the capacity of California’s public universities and community colleges to produce STEM graduates.  STEM degrees typically require intensive lab work and technical equipment that is more expensive than the inputs required for non-STEM majors.  As budgets are reduced for education at the state-level, it is highly likely STEM inputs will be reduced, further exasperating the STEM problems in California. Not only this, but as the job outlook within the state diminishes, the likelihood of students enrolling in STEM and subsequently seeking employment will decline, as well; further undermining California’s attempt to bounce back from the current recession.

Issues and Antecedents of Multiple STEM Definitions
===================================================

<!-- The conceptual solution to all of the aforementioned problems has been identified as STEM by a variety of sources.  With this concept, money has followed.  Between the grants of the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education, over $480 million dollars were spent on STEM, in 2006, alone (National Science Board, 2007). -->
STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering and math.  However, such a definition does not properly address what STEM is, precisely.  Conceptually, views of STEM are quite diverse. Recently, the GAO (2012) released another report which was critical of the lack of coordination between STEM programs across governmental agencies. In their survey, the report noted less than half of responding agencies coordinated with other agencies.
One of the major issues confronting STEM is data reporting and longitudinal tracking.  The National Center for Education Statistics (2009) has focused on undergraduate student progress through the STEM pipeline in an attempt to understand the demographics of students entering STEM majors, the retention and successful completion of those students in STEM majors. To date, their research results support the findings of other agencies cited earlier in our discussion. 
The federal government has dedicated funding necessary to address many of these issues.  In their 2006 report, the GAO (2006) stated that $2.8 billion was appropriated in fiscal year 2004 for over 200 STEM programs.  Most of these programs were in the form of financial aid for students or institutional grants to support infrastructure at colleges and universities.  They further note that approximately half of these organizations have been or will be evaluated but the nature of that evaluation was not provided.
Thus, multiple organizations with a variety of STEM-related interests have asserted their own definition of STEM. Sometimes, these definitions even extend beyond purely educational agencies and organizations. For instance, STEM has also been recognized as an educational pathway to achieve the goal of a new green economy, connecting environmental concerns and problem-solving with science, technology, engineering and math (Arnett, Kozlowski, Peach & Valera, 2009).  According to White & Walsh (2008), “New energy technologies will depend on a workforce that is prepared and trained to build and implement them. But the skilled workers for these industries will not emerge from a vacuum.” (page 9)
Many believe that STEM is any one of the disciplines within the acronym: science, technology, engineering and math or sum of the four fields.  We illustrate these extremes in figure 1. The top pane illustrates a loose definition where a major could be considered STEM if it incorporates any amount of science, engineering, technology, or mathematics--what we term a disjunctive definition of STEM. The lower pane shows a strict definition for majors that incorporates all four components--the conjunctive definition. Each pane shows the two extremes in a conceptual approach toward defining STEM, so the difficulty in defining STEM is where to draw the separation between STEM and non-STEM programs.
We furthur illustrate the impact the various definitions of STEM in figure 2. In this hypthetical representation, we illustrate STEM as concentric circles akin to a universe. Each major is represented by a circle, the size of which represents the hypothetical number of students. The center of the diagram represents the conjunctive definition of STEM, where majors consists of all four subjects. Yet, as we move away from the conjunctive definition, we question where to draw the line. To illustrate, the darker circle represents a hypothetical definition while the dashed area represents a slightly broader definition. Choosing between a more conjunctive or disjunctive definition may include or exclude disciplines "on the border". As we will demonstrate in the next section, programs on the border may be large and dramatically change the composition of students.

A Conceptual Definition
=======================
As we mentioned earlier, STEM is the ackronym for "science", "technology", "engineering", and "mathematics". Everyone will have a, at least, vague comprehension of each subject but lacks precision which permits a conceptual muddling of STEM. Philosophers and historians in the area of "science", "technology", "engineering", and "mathematics" have best articulated the interplay between these subjects. Namely, each subject are independent, but rely on each other for progress. We derive our own conceptualization of STEM by defining each subject based on prior literature, then explore how they are interconnected.
In the last century, research within science and research within technology have become practically indistinguishable. Science and technology both depend on mathematics as the formal language to discuss each discipline. Engineering wraps these concepts into implementation. We argue that the interdependent progress of science and technology needs to be emphasized in the definition of STEM.
Scientists often refer to replicable experiments as the defining characteristic of science. While important, a more important facet is of falsification. Generally, empiricism is crucial to the epistemological advancement within science. Specifically, Popper's (1959) formulation of falsification, though controversial in some areas of education, suggests the reason science is successful is the ability to discard inaccurate theories and retain those that have withstood significant testing.
While modern science is indistinguishable from mathematics, the latter is simply a standard language to communicate results and conduct experiments. Mathematical formulations assists replicability since it provides people with a precise expectation in the laboratory. Those formulations can also be used to make deductions on deeper, unobserved aspects of science, such as the exploration of the Higgs boson. Today it may be difficult for students to distinguish mathematics and science. Yet, the experiments of Michael Faraday and the formulations of James Maxwell provide an example distinguishing science and mathematics. Faraday, a scientist with little formal training, was able to suggest physical relationships, notably between electricity and magnetism, through raw experimentation. However, it left some to be desired since he was not able to express it in formal mathematics as commonly done in the early 19th century. James Maxwell, trained in mathematics, formulated many of Faraday's most important experiments through four mathematical equations, known as the Maxwell Equations.
A scientist's principal concern is empirical fact, which is derived through method and testing. Engineers must consider pragmatic issues related to scientific discovery. Namely, when science is translated into technology, the engineer must consider the functional requirements related to the device's operation. Engineering bring science into operations through processes that are different than the scientific process. First, the device(s) are conceptualized by drafting a conceptual sketch or computer model, such as computer-aided drafting (CAD). Then the device(s) are tested by manufacturing a prototype.
Franssen, Lokhorst, van de Poel (2009) contend the manufacturing process is not considered as "design", but the process "is often reflected in the functional requirements of a device." For our purposes, we ultimately rejected many manufacturing-specific programs as STEM for this reason. However, we consider the maintenance of the manufacturing process as STEM. Individuals who service equipment designed by engineers are equipped with complimentary training to the engineers themselves. Community colleges tend to serve this area of the workforce—the occupations which fix devices created by engineers. For instance, HVAC occupations must know the scientific principles which funnel air efficiently around a structure. We refer to this component of engineering as engineering technology whose principal focus is to maintain and operate technology created by engineers.
Our final obstacle is to define the technology component of STEM. Technology can be interpreted widely. Modern technology must meet four criteria, it is: scientifically derived, contain a concrete component to count as technology (e.g., circuit board); must enter into some set of praxes which humans can use; a relation between the technologies and the humans who use, design, make, or modify the technologies in question (Ihde, 1993). In addition, we focus on technology that can be manipulated to advance and test science, math, and engineering. This last component narrows technology to that which is specific to STEM and not the generally used modern technology in the current economy (e.g., office productivity software).
Therefore, our conceptual model of STEM, shown in figure 1, has five components: science; math; engineering; engineering technology; and technology. We focus on the overlapping components of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics which reinforce each other. Thus, we do not consider some mathematical-based disciplines, such as actuarial science, as STEM. For example, actuaries do not practice mathematics to compliment science or to advance engineering.
This model fits within the history of science. Early science was able to exist independently from modern technology. However, science—with the use of mathematics—led some to design technology, which was in turn used to advance science. Presently, science could not advance without using technology that was created from earlier scientific discoveries. Quite simply, it's hard to imagine any science in the last century that could exist without the availability of electricity. Figure 4 shows a specific example of how Faraday's experimentation and Maxwell's formulation led to advancements in engineering and technology which led to further advancements in modern computing.
We also gave pause to the following statements provided in the National Academy of Sciences (2007) report Rising above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future.  “Our economy depends on the knowledge that fuels the growth of business and plants the seeds of new industries, which in turn provides rewarding employment for commensurately educated workers” (National Academy of Sciences, 2007, pg 37);  and:
“The visible products of research, however, are made possible by a large enterprise mostly hidden from public view—fundamental and applied research, an intensively trained workforce, and a national infrastructure that provides risk capital to support the nation’s science and engineering innovation enterprise. All that activity, and its sustaining public support, fuels the steady flow of knowledge and provides the mechanism for converting information into the products and services that create jobs and improve the quality of modern life. Maintaining that vast and complex enterprise during an age of competition and globalization is challenging, but it is essential to the future of the United States.” (National Academy of Sciences, 2007, pg 42-43)
Given these statements, we surmised that if the inputs of STEM are funding and knowledge and its long-term outputs are economic growth and prosperity, then it is more appropriate to view STEM as a process, not a subject.
The final synthesis for developing our conceptual understanding of STEM was inspired by Minnesota Department of Education STEM Specialist, Dr. Joel Donna.  In his work, Donna (2009) discussed the idea of “integrative STEM.”  While integrative STEM in not a new idea, we found that Dr. Donna’s examination of the intricate and inexorable relationships between science, technology, engineering and math helped ground our idea of STEM as a process.  Our conceptual understanding of STEM, based on these ideas is thus revealed in Figure 1. To understand how our conceptual model weaves these ideas into practice together, we used the concept of electromagnetism and its evolution as demonstrated in Figure 4.

The diagrams are not the only example illustrating the connectivity of all four STEM subjects. The National Academy of Sciences (2007) illustrated the same principle:
"Enormous economic gains can be traced to research in harnessing electricity, which grew out of basic research (such as that conducted by Michael Faraday and James Maxwell) and applied research (such as that by Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse). Furthermore, today’s semiconductor integrated circuits can be traced to the development of transistors and integrated circuits, which began with basic research into the structure of the atom and the development of quantum mechanics by Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli, Werner Heisenberg, and Erwin Schrodinger and was realized through the applied research of Robert Noyce and Jack Kilby. In virtually all those examples, the original researchers did not—or could not—foresee the consequences of the work they were performing, let alone its economic implications. The fundamental research typically was driven by the desire to answer a specific question about nature or about an application of technology. The greatest influence of such work often is removed from its genesis, but the genius of the US research enterprise has been its ability to afford its best minds the opportunity to pursue fundamental questions (p. 51)"

Technical Definition
--------------------
After defining a conceptual approach, we sought to derive a list of CIPs used at Iowa community colleges which fit our conceptual definition. We chose to use the six-digit CIP to locate the descriptive narrative within the CIP Definition Guidebook and assessed those CIPs based on the stated wording in contrast to our conceptual STEM model.  CIPs included in our definition were chosen because they were involved in testing, designing, creating and maintaining technology and using it to advance human knowledge.  Of course, some degree of subjectivity will be present in our selection as some CIPs were not always evident in how they would operate within our STEM model. However, we felt our methodology based on the objective narratives best limits the opportunity of arbitrary inclusion of certain CIPs within STEM or attempts to discredit our definitions using slippery-slope assertions.
As we stated, a certain degree of ambiguity was present for a number of CIPs due to the short narratives provided within the CIP guidebook and our lack of exposure to those programs.  For CIPs that were questionably STEM, we referred back to our database of consensus among technical STEM definitions by other entities.  This was valuable as it gave us a barometer for understanding what other institutions regard as STEM and how many of them regard certain CIPs as STEM.  While we are not required to follow a specific standard, nor duplicate the understanding of STEM by another institution, this gave us an idea of where our conclusions fell within the definition continuum.  Further, we were able to articulate the reasons for our deviation from other institutions in our definitions and justify specific CIPs for inclusion.  While this was not a significant determinate in how we selected CIPs for STEM, it was useful in indicating which CIPs deserved greater attention and focus as we considered the meaning of each CIP’s stated definition within the guidebook.
In our discussions we had contention regarding Agriculture, Nursing, and Logistics. With Agriculture and Nursing, the ability of these subjects to fit into the STEM model was questioned.  Ultimately we chose to include certain Agriculture programs like Biotechnology as it is the foundation for bridging inorganic technology and organic manipulation.  On the other hand, we chose to exclude Nursing on the grounds that they primarily use technology to identify already understood health issues and tend to be less involved in design, creation and maintenance of technology.  We anticipate controversy to arise from this decision as there appears to be a divide over Nursing amongst our institutions.  Four of the ten institutions in our study included Nursing: Iowa Board of Regents, STEM Equity Pipeline, Iowa Workforce Development and the Minnesota Department of Education.  Those that chose not to include nursing were: the National Science Foundation, the National Center for Educational Statistics, the University of Wisconsin System, the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Minnesota State Colleges and Universities.  Given the divide on Nursing and our confidence in our methodology, we felt the exclusion of Nursing was justified. 
With Logistics, we questioned the use of science and mathematics with the precise definition of engineering.  In particular, we discussed whether processes that utilized math were essentially technology or merely management tool.  Further, we needed to determine whether technology needed to be tangible.  Ultimately, we concluded that while technology in STEM need not necessarily be tangible, it most often is and that we are generally averse to including management principles in STEM unless they clearly fall within the STEM model.  Further, while five of our ten institutions included Business Management, Marketing, and Related Support Sciences (CIP Group 52.00) within their definitions of STEM, of the 94 six-digit CIPs within this group only 12 CIPs were considered STEM by any institution and only two codes being considered STEM by more than one institution, 52.1304 Actuarial Science was regarded as STEM by four institutions and 52.1201, Management Information Systems was considered STEM by two institutions.  So while roughly half our institutions considered at least one CIP from Business Management in their definition of STEM, no institution regarded the entire group as STEM and a super-minority of those CIPs were considered STEM by those institutions.  Further, no institution regarded Logistics (52.0203) as STEM.  Given these considerations, Logistics was not included.
In reviewing the implications of our conclusions on STEM we compared our selections with another entity in Iowa, the Public Universities Board of Regents.  In this we found a considerable amount of agreement between our definitions and the Board of Regents.  




Data
====
The authors conducted institutional surveying of Midwestern states, national institutions and nonprofits in an attempt to discover the popular understanding of STEM. We attempted to gather the precise definition of STEM from the twenty-five institutions listed 
Iowa uses the Certification of Instructional Programs (CIPs) codes for its data tracking and reporting.  CIP codes are a taxonomic scheme created in 1980, by the National Center for Education Statistics. CIP codes are useful for applying objective designations of educational subjects and quantifying them for data tracking, reporting and analysis (National Center for Education Statistics, 2000).  For the sake of applicability, we were primarily interested in programs utilizing CIP codes.  
Where possible, definitions were collected from available, published sources provided by these institutions.  In the event definitions were not assessable, the Iowa Department of Education conducted informal, electronic surveys of those organizations.  Table 1 shows the following agencies and institutions that were reviewed or contacted.

[Organizations Contacted for STEM Survey]


A great deal of information regarding STEM was provided by many of these sources.  However, among the institutions that either had published or responded to our surveys, ten were viewed as having the technical definitions of STEM that were desired for our comparative analysis.
The 10 institutions selected for our comparative analysis were: The National Science Foundation; Iowa Board of Regents; STEM Equity Pipeline; Iowa Community Colleges; Iowa Workforce Development; National Center for Education Statistics; Minnesota Department of Education; University of Wisconsin System; Missouri Department of Higher Education and Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. 
Our comparative analysis revealed that there was only a limited degree of consensus amongst institutions as to what defines STEM.  Of the 1,848 CIPs found in the 2000 CIP Guidebook, 897 of them were considered to be STEM by at least one institution.  Of the 50 two-digit CIP groups, 30 groups were considered STEM by at least one institution.  Varying degrees of consensus were found amongst either individual CIP codes or groups but no two institutions had identical definitions of STEM.  However, greater degrees of consensus where found among the following CIP groups: 1.00 Agriculture, 11.00 Computer and Information Sciences, 14.00 Engineering, 15.00 Engineering Technology and Technicians, 26.00 Biological and Biomedical Sciences, 27.00 Mathematics and Statistics, and 40.00 Physical Sciences.  Consistency on individual CIPs was less evident as some institutions chose to include entire CIP groups in their definitions, others chose to include whole CIP sub-groups and others chose to select only individual CIPs amongst CIP groups and/or subgroups.


Consideration and Methodology
=============================

The vast majority of CIPs offered by Iowa’s community colleges are not recognized as STEM by either the Board of Regents or the Committee.  Of the 231 CIPs offered by Iowa’s community colleges 162 were not recognized by either the Committee or the Regents.  Of the 69 remaining CIPs, 48 are considered STEM by the Committee but are not offered by Iowa’s State Universities.  Since they do not offer these programs, we can conclude that variation between the purposes of an institution will yield reasonable differences in STEM definition. 
Of the 21 remaining CIPs, 9 are considered to be STEM by the Committee and the Board of Regents.  Taken together, there is agreement on 219 or 94.8 percent of all CIPs offered by Iowa’s community colleges.
The following were considered STEM by Board of Regents but were excluded from our definitions: Agriculture, Environmental Studies, Natural Resources Management, Nursing, E Agribusiness, Arboriculture, Mortuary Science, Dental Hygiene, Radiologic Technology, Human Services/Disability Studies, Logistics, and Construction Management.  Each of these CIPs were questioned and excluded for different reasons.  Some were excluded by the fact that they were more focused on business management than on science or engineering.  Others were excluded because the use of the word “science” within the CIP title but their use was not reflective of our understanding of the scientific process.  Others still were excluded because while they superficially would be considered STEM, we could not rationally justify their inclusion using our understanding of STEM as a process.

Results and Conclusion
======================
The Iowa Department of Education maintains the Community College MIS, which contains enrollment and outcomes information for all community college students in Iowa.  Based on the results produced by our methodology, using our conceptual STEM model, we found that the commonly referred to gender gap in STEM enrollment is applicable and significant for Iowa’s community colleges. According to 2007-08 enrollment data, roughly 84.05% of all STEM majors were male while only 15.82% were female.  This is nearly a 6:1 ratio of male-to-female enrollment in STEM majors. That proportion is significantly different from the 1:1.45 male-to-female ratio in Iowa community colleges (Iowa Department of Education, 2009). 
To understand the breakdown of ethnic demographics, one needs to understand the current ethnic make-up of Iowa community colleges.  Whites comprise 89% of enrollment in Iowa community colleges, while 3.6% are black, 2.2% are Hispanic, and persons of Asian descent comprise 1.8 percent (Iowa Department of Education, 2009). In relation to STEM enrollments, we found that whites make up roughly 83.83%, black persons 3.66% and Latino or Hispanics 2.84%.  This suggests that black and Hispanic/Latino students are proportionately reflected in STEM programs. 
For the state of Iowa, we can infer that the gender gap between male and female enrollment at post-secondary, community college institutions remains significant.  However, there are positive indicators for racial equity in proportional enrollment amongst white, black and Latino or Hispanic persons in STEM programs.  Given the overwhelming proportion of males to STEM, it is understandable that the majority of programs are dominated by men.  Further analysis suggests that certain programs have gender concentrations that favor women over men.  Interestingly, females outnumber males in Animal Production Technology and Dental Laboratory Technology nearly 4:1.  Females also represent a majority of Biotechnology students.  Understanding the attraction of females to these specific programs may assist in formulating initiatives to address gender equity issues in other STEM programs.  
In respect to ethnicity, the proportion of whites over other ethnicities in the general population makes extrapolating meaningful inferences difficult within our dataset.  In reviewing the data, we found that the programs with higher general enrollment have higher proportion of minority students.  Programs with low enrollment frequently have a handful of minority students and many have none.  To what degree this is simply a reflection of Iowa’s general demographics and overrepresentation of males in STEM programs or a function of racial inequity is difficult to ascertain within this study.

The United States is confronting a number of issues regarding science, technology, engineering and math.  To address these problems, various STEM programs have been proposed and funded.  However, our research has revealed that STEM holds different meanings, both technical and conceptual, to different institutions.  While theoretical diversity is often valued for its ability to produce innovative results, it has diluted the applicability of STEM data and reports across institutions and agencies.  Much of this is attributable to the lack of a conceptual understanding of STEM or a technical definition used and mandated by a central authority.  Understanding this, stakeholders in STEM must assess the status quo in STEM.  Should we move towards national standards regarding STEM, for the purpose of data measurement, integrity and cross-applicability?  If so, who should determine those parameters and under what process should those definitions be developed?  If we pursued such a path, the benefits would include a national understanding of what STEM is and what specific goals are to be pursued.  In addition, a move towards national standards would provide greater accountability and more transparent measurement of STEM results over time and in comparison to similar initiatives.
However, there are a number of concerns to be acknowledged in moving towards national standards.  First, such a move would be controversial as STEM may be a source of major funding for many valuable programs that could be excluded from revised definitions.  Further, one of the major underpinnings of STEM initiatives is innovation and creativity.  Would national standards suppress or dissuade innovative programming from occurring?  Is this an acceptable risk in pursuit of cross-applicability and program accountability?  Another issue to be addressed is the STEM pipeline and to what degree the different stakeholders (K-12, community colleges, universities, workforce development agencies, not-for-profit local, state, regional and national partners, federal agencies, education professionals, administrators, and funding bodies) have inherently different missions and contributions regarding STEM that would warrant differing definitions of STEM and how or if these issues can be reasonably reconciled.  These concerns would need to be addressed and brought before stakeholders in order to find the most productive method for developing a more meaningful and effective STEM definition.
There are opportunities to address these issues in the future.  First, any number of entities can assume the role of speaker to generate a grass-roots dialog regarding STEM programming and STEM conceptual and technical definitions.  Second, the process of updating the CIP 2000 guidebook is underway and will soon be updated for 2010.  Entities that track and report data on STEM will may need to revise their collection and reporting systems to reflect those changes. Since this will need to be done by the majority of STEM stakeholders, this event could act as a catalyst for institutions to adopt or make changes to their own definitions of STEM.
Clearly defining STEM—both conceptually and programmatically through CIPs—can enhance the evaluation of STEM programming. In particular, state longitudinal data systems implements through recent Institute for Education Sciences grants and mandated by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (State Fiscal Stabilization Fund Program, 2009) and Race to the Top (Overview Information; Race to the Top Fund; Notice Inviting Applications for New Awards for Fiscal Year (FY) 2010, 2009) have equipped states to study long-term outcomes of STEM curriculum. For example, Iowa has spent nearly $3 million on implement Project Lead The Way (PLTW), a hands-on STEM curriculum in middle and high schools. The Iowa Department of Education has launched an evaluation which will measure whether PLTW casually increases participation in STEM majors in postsecondary institutions (Schenk, Rethwisch, Laanan, Chapman, Starobin, and Zhang, 2009). The evaluation will measure the likelihood of participating in the aforementioned CIPs after participating in PLTW.
Regardless of the position of a STEM stakeholder concerning technical definitions; it is our desire to encourage discussion regarding the purpose and definition of STEM within the United States.  If we can promote discussion amongst the numerous and diverse entities that are involved in STEM, we can foster a culture of cooperation amongst STEM entities.  Hopefully, with a culture of cooperation amongst STEM stakeholders, we can begin to see more significant progress in addressing the various problems that persist within the STEM pipeline; ultimately resulting in more positive economic and socially equitable outcomes for students, workers, educators and businesses within the United States.
